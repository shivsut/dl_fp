calculated by extract_features()
- kart_direction - float2
- kart_angle - float
- kart_to_puck_direction - float2
- kart_to_puck_angle - float
- kart_to_puck_angle_difference - float

- kart_to_opponent0 - float2
- kart_to_opponent0_angle -  float

Somethings that can help
- ball velocity
- ball acceleration?

Rewards (https://github.com/Rolv-Arild/Necto)
 agents velocity towards ball
 balls velocity towards goal
 +ve reward on goal
 -ve reward on opponent goal
 +ve reward if shot on target
 +ve on making a save
 +ve on impeding opponent


psuedo code for necto rewards
- game state reward = ball_pos closer to goal (continuos)
-
